      <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

      <p>KitchenProof respects your right to control your personal data. This page explains how to request deletion of your data from our platform — including any data collected through our WhatsApp Business API integration and Google Sign-In.</p>
      <p>This page also serves as the <strong>Data Deletion Callback URL</strong> as required by Meta's platform policies for apps using the WhatsApp Business API and Facebook Login.</p>

      <h2>What Data We Hold</h2>
      <p>Depending on how you use KitchenProof, we may hold the following data about you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, and Google profile information (from Google Sign-In).</li>
        <li>Your WhatsApp phone number (if you are a registered team member in an organization).</li>
        <li>Task completion records and compliance history associated with your account.</li>
        <li>Photo proof images you submitted via WhatsApp or the web app.</li>
        <li>WhatsApp message logs (inbound and outbound) associated with your phone number.</li>
        <li>Login session data and activity logs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Request Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>You can request deletion of your personal data in the following ways:</p>

      <h3>Option 1 — Email Request (All Users)</h3>
      <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@kitchenproof.in">privacy@kitchenproof.in</a> with the subject line: <strong>"Data Deletion Request"</strong>.</p>
      <p>Please include in your email:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your full name.</li>
        <li>The email address associated with your KitchenProof account (or the phone number if you are a WhatsApp-only user).</li>
        <li>The name of the organization you were part of (if known).</li>
        <li>Whether you want to delete your individual data only, or close and delete the entire organization account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will confirm receipt within 48 hours and complete the deletion within <strong>30 days</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Option 2 — In-App Account Deletion (Organization Owners)</h3>
      <p>If you are the Owner of an organization on KitchenProof:</p>
      <ol style="padding-left: 20px; color: rgba(237,237,245,0.55); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.75;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Sign in to KitchenProof at your app URL.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Scroll to the <strong>Danger Zone</strong> section.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Click <strong>"Delete Organization"</strong> and confirm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will permanently delete your organization, all users, all task data, and all associated records within 30 days.</p>

      <h2>What Gets Deleted</h2>
      <p>Upon a confirmed deletion request, we will permanently delete:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account profile (name, email, Google ID).</li>
        <li>Your WhatsApp phone number and message history associated with our system.</li>
        <li>All task completion records and compliance history linked to your account.</li>
        <li>All photo proof images you submitted.</li>
        <li>Any organization data if you are the sole owner.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some anonymized, aggregated statistical data may be retained for internal analytics and cannot be linked back to you.</p>
      <p>We may retain certain data for longer if required by applicable law or for legitimate legal purposes (e.g., fraud prevention).</p>

      <h2>Confirmation of Deletion</h2>
      <p>After completing the deletion, we will send a confirmation email to the address you provided in your request, confirming that your data has been deleted from our systems.</p>

      <h2>Facebook / Meta Data</h2>
      <p>If you connected your account via a Meta product or your data was processed through the WhatsApp Business API, you can also manage your Facebook data directly through Facebook's tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/540977946302970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook's Data Deletion Tool</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Off-Facebook Activity</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that deleting data from Facebook does not automatically delete data from KitchenProof's systems. You must submit a separate request to us using the methods above.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>For any questions about data deletion, contact us at:</p>
      <ul>

      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the KitchenProof platform, including our web application and WhatsApp-integrated services (collectively, the "Service"), operated by KitchenProof ("we", "our", or "us").</p>
      <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement to use the Service. By using KitchenProof, you represent that you meet these requirements.</p>
      <p>The Service is intended for use by businesses — specifically food service operators, cloud kitchens, and dark kitchens. Use by individuals for personal purposes is not the intended use case.</p>

      <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
      <p>To access the Service, you must sign in using a valid Google account. By doing so, you authorize us to receive your basic profile information (name, email, profile picture) as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

      <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service in any way that violates applicable local, national, or international laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>Transmit unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or spam via WhatsApp or any other channel through the Service.</li>
        <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or falsely represent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service or its related systems.</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service.</li>
        <li>Upload or transmit any malicious code, viruses, or harmful content.</li>
        <li>Use the Service to harass, threaten, or harm any individual.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the Service.</li>
        <li>Use the Service in violation of Meta's <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp Business Policy</a> or <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Platform Terms</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. WhatsApp Usage</h2>
      <p>KitchenProof integrates with the Meta WhatsApp Business API to deliver operational notifications and collect task completions. By adding staff phone numbers to your organization and enabling WhatsApp notifications, you represent and warrant that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have the consent of the individuals whose phone numbers you add to the platform to receive WhatsApp messages from KitchenProof on your behalf.</li>
        <li>The phone numbers you add belong to employees or contractors of your organization.</li>
        <li>You will not use the WhatsApp integration to send messages unrelated to operational task management.</li>
        <li>You will comply with all applicable laws regarding electronic communications and messaging consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Organization Data and Responsibility</h2>
      <p>As an organization owner or administrator, you are responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accuracy of organization and team member information entered into the platform.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that staff members whose phone numbers are registered have consented to receive WhatsApp notifications.</li>
        <li>All task templates, compliance records, and operational data created within your organization workspace.</li>
        <li>Managing access levels and roles assigned to team members.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The Service, including all software, design, trademarks, logos, and content created by KitchenProof, is owned by us and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our prior written consent.</p>
      <p>You retain ownership of all data you input into the Service (your task records, proof images, and operational data). By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to process and store this data solely to provide the Service to you.</p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
      <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.</li>
        <li>WhatsApp message delivery is guaranteed — delivery depends on Meta's infrastructure and recipient device availability.</li>
        <li>The Service will meet all your specific compliance or regulatory requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, KITCHENPROOF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
      <p>Our total liability for any claims arising from these Terms or use of the Service shall not exceed the amount paid by you to KitchenProof in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

      <h2>9. Termination</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for violation of these Terms, or for any other reason with reasonable notice.</p>

      <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. Data deletion will follow the process described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We may revise these Terms at any time. We will notify users of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, sending a notification. Continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
